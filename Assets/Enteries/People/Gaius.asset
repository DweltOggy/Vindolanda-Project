  description: The Soldiers here at vindolanda are Auxilaries! Learn more!
  expandedDescription: Auxilia were introduced as non-citizen soldiers that were
    attached to the citizen legions by Augustis in 30BC. They provided almost all
    of the Roman cavalry and they were all volunteers. They would often volunteer
    to join the Roman army in order to escape poverty.
  funFacts: '1) They had salaries that were twenty percent lower than legionnaires!

    2)
    After they served for 25 years, then they were classes as Roman citizens, along
    with their children!'
