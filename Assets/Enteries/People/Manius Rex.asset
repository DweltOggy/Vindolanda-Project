  description: The Romans lived in a very strict society! Learn az little more!
  expandedDescription: Roman citizens were divided into two classes- the Plebeians
    who made up most of the citizens in Roman society, these people were mainyly
    soldiers, craftsmen and farmers. There was no way that a Plebian could become
    a Patrician, you had to be born into the that class. The Patricians who were
    the ruling class. There were certain families that would be considered to be
    in this upper class, these would make up a small part of the populations but
    they held most of the power in society.
  funFacts: 1) There was a revolt in 494 BC, as the Plebians fought back against
    the ruling class. Over the course of 200 years the Plebians gained more and more
    rights!
