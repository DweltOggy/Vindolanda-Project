  expandedDescription: Vestal Virgins were priestesses of Vesta (the Goddess of the
    hearth). They all took a 30 year vow of chastity and were allowed to not marry
    and have children even though it was expected of them in Roman society. The priestesses
    usually knew they wanted to be Vestal Virgins at age 6-10 years old. During their
    thirty years they would spend 10 years as students, 10 years as servants and
    10 years as teachers. After the 30 years they were then replaced.
  funFacts: 1) There were only ever seven Vestal Virgins!
