  description: Slavery was an unfortunate aspect of Roman society.
  expandedDescription: 'Slaves were the third social class in Roman society, they
    played a massively important role. They provided manual labour and domestic labour.
    There were some slaves that were highl specialised and would therefore be used
    in highly skilled jobs such as craftmanship. Citizens who worked as accountants
    and physicians were usually slaves.

    Slaves were considered property by
    Roman law and they had noo rights or legal protection. Over the years slaves
    got more and more legal protection and would eventually be able to formally complain
    against the treatment they received by their masters.'
  funFacts: 1) Slaves would be forced to sleep on the floor, in heaps of straw and
    hay!
