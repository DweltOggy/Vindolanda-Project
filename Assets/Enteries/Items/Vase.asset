  name: Roman Art
  description: 
  expandedDescription: Roman art was was something that was enjoyed by many in society
    but some cold be considered a luxxury item. These were made of metal, gems, ivory
    and glass. Other forms of art included sculptures, paintings and decorative coins.
    A large amount of sculptures have survived over the years and can be found at
    many museums and historic sites across the country however there are very few
    paintings that actually survived. Many examples of beautiful Roman art that are
    displayed in the museum at Vindolanda when you next visit!
  funFacts: '1) The Romans were famous for their beautiful mosaics, these could be
    found at the floors of villas and bath houses!

    2) Art can also be seen in
    many of the Roman buildings, many of which can still be seen today which would
    make them 1000s of years old!'
