  description: Learn more about roamn daily life!
  expandedDescription: "Roman daily life varied from person to person and was often
    dependent on class and gender. It was quite typical for girls to stay at home
    with their mothers and tend to the home whilst the boys attended school. In school
    they learned how to speak, write, tell time, use and count money and other lessons
    that were designed to help them day-to-day.\nThere were many jobs that people
    may have had in Roman times such as farming, baking, building, trading and clothes
    making, doctors, teachers, writers, lawyers and soldiers. Although most people
    sopped working when it got to 12pm, only working 6 hours! \nLots of time was
    spent socialising and on entertainment. Romans valued their leisure time and
    used this to pursue their interests. This could be with dancing, sports, reading,
    art and music."
  funFacts: '1) Romans loved food and dinner time. They would eat meals of wheatmeal
    porridge, salads, eggs, breads, seafood and much more. with desser being fruit
    and sweet cakes. Sounds so tasty!

    2) Did you know that when a Roman was
    hosting a dinner party that they could have as many as seven different courses?'
