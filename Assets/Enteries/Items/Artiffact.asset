  description: Learn more about roman religions!
  expandedDescription: Religion was very important to the Romans and to practice
    Christianity could become very dangerous for that person. Christianity was banned
    and punished for many years. Christians would have to meet in secret, even hiding
    underground in order to practice their chosen religion. In AD 313, the Emperor
    Constantine made Christianity legal  and in AD 391 the worship of other gods
    was mad illegal.
  funFacts: 1) Romans even fed Christians to lions as entertainment!
