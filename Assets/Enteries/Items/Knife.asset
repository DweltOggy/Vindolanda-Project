  description: Romans didn't have forks like us!
  expandedDescription: 'Romans did not use any form of fork when they were eating
    their food but instead would use spoons and knives, they would even use their
    hands and fingers to eat their meals. Eating with your hands would be more popular
    as utensils were quite expensive and were used by the upper class in society.
    Due to not having many utensils the food would be cut into small bite sized pieces
    that they could eat easilty- these were called finger foods.

    Plates and
    dishes that were made out of wood and pottery were used by the lower classes
    whilst metal, tin, bronze and pewter plates and utensils were used by the upper
    classes.'
