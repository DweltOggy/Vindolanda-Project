  description: 
  expandedDescription: 'Roman jewellery was made from coloure gemstones, glass and
    metals to make ornate and beautifuly unique pieces.  Jewellery was used as a
    social statement, a way o ftelling people which class you came from- the more
    expensive and extravagant the better! Women typically collected and wore more
    than men as they would have pierced ears, would wear bracelets, necklaces and
    rings.

    Men would wear less jewellery than women, they would wear rings and
    were sometimes found to wear pendants.

    Children would also wear little trinkets
    and amulets which would be worn by the child to make sure that they were kept
    safe from illness and misfortune.'
  funFacts: '1) Womens jewellery was very important to them as this was the only
    wealth that they were allowed to keep separate from their husbands!

    2) Both
    men and women wore Fibula which were beautifully ornate brooches!'
