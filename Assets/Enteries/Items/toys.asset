  expandedDescription: 'Roman children loved to play with their toys just like the
    children of today. They played with dolls, along with playhouses, wooden horses,
    play swords, bells, kites and carts. all of these toys were hand made, either
    by the parents/family or bought/traded. Girls loved to play with dolls, made
    from rags if you were poor or wax and clay. Boys loved to think about going to
    war just like their brothers, uncles and fathers so they would play with wooden
    shields and swords. There were even toys for babies such as rattles and balls
    made from wood.

    Romans also played many games such as Battledore  which
    is very similar to badminton, they played lots of ball games and a game that
    resembled hockey. Dice games, board games and card games were also very popular.
    Remnants of these can be found at the Vindolanda museum'
