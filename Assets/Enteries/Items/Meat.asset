  description: The Romans atte very differently thann we do! Find out more!
  expandedDescription: 'The roman diet was generally quite healthy, they primarily
    ate cereals and legumes. The sides would include vegetables, cheese, meat and
    fish. The sauces could me made from fermented fish, herbs, spices, honey and
    vinegar. There was very little ways to keep food cold so the food that they ate
    was dependant on what was fresh and readily available.

    Romans generally
    ate quite lavishly if you were upper class. However the lower classes would eat
    legumes, grains, bread, eggs and cheese of a lower and cheaper quality.'
  funFacts: '1) Roman Legions staple ration was wheat, from this you could make grain.
    They would also be supplied with rations of bread, vegetables and meats!

    2)
    A Gladiators diet was much more grim, they would eat wheat, barley and beans!'
