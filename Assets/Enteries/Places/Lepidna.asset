    surviving examples of the use of ink letters in the time of the Romans. The tablets
    were maded out of wood, specificaly made from nearby trees in the Northumbria
    area. Over 500 tablets have been excavated from the site and have given an excellent
    view into the life of Romans, specifically Vindolanda. You play as Sulpicia Lepidina
