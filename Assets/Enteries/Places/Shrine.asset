  description: The temple at vindolnda.
  expandedDescription: The Romans thought themselves to be highly religious people
    and a lof of their actions were a direct refelction os their relationship to
    their Gods. We have all heard of many of the famous Gods such as Venus, Apollo
    and Neptune. They all served a special purpose in the lives of the Romans who
    wouldleave offerings at their altars, where they would worship and pray to their
    Gods. There would be many public altars/temples that would be used by the lower
    classes but the upper classes would be more fortunate to have them in their homes.
    Make sure to look for where the altar would have been when you visit Vindolanda!
  funFacts: '1) Each temple that the Romans worshipped at would be dedicated to one
    God each. A temple where they worshipped all of the Gods was called a Pantheon.

    2)
    Romans even sacrificed animals in their temples!'
