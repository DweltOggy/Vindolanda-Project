  description: The Roman fort and village of vindolnada and the setting of our game.
  expandedDescription: 'Vindolanda was a Roman fort in Northumbria, Northern England.
    It sits just south of Hadrians Wall, a large wall that ran from coast to coast,
    set to protect Northern Engalnd. Vindolanda started out as a small fort made
    from wood and turf, over the next 100 years they made the transition from early
    wooden forts to one made from stone. Several circular stone huts were built between
    208 to 211AD- the remains of these can still be seen at the forts site today.
    Make sure to keep a look out! Over the years, the fort grew and grew, even including
    a Vicus which was a village that was self-run and a large Bath House that would
    have been used by the soldiers and villagers. At the height of Vindolandas use,
    the fort could hold anywhere up to 1,000 soldiers.

    The site is filled with
    exciting findings such as keys, combs, pots and even a pair of Roman boxing gloves!
    All are available for you to view at Chesterholm Museum, the museum at Vindolanda.
    So make sure to plan your next visit!'
