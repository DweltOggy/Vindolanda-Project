  description: The place where the soldiers come to sleep and live.
  expandedDescription: 'Barracks were also known as Strigae. In the North of England,
    barracks would be made from wood or stone as it could get quite cold. The ones
    located in Vindolanda were built around 105 AD.

    The Barracks is where the
    soldiers would live, sleep and work. the Barracks would often have a fireplace
    to keep the soldiers warm, although the barracks may be quite crowded as there
    would be several bunk beds for the soldiers to sleep. The Barracks would also
    be the place that soldiers would leave their personal armour such as their shields,
    armour and swords!'
  funFacts: '1) In Vindolanas barracks they found the remains of a young child aged
    between 8 and 10. They were thought to have died 1,800 years ago!

    2) The
    Centurian or Commander would get to stay in a tent/barrack that was double the
    size of anyone elses quarters!'
