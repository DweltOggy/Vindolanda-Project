  description: The place where both soldiers and civilians could come to rest and
    relax.
  expandedDescription: '"Bathing was extremely important to Roman society, all social
    classes could be found bathing in Bath houses. Bathing was not a private activity,
    many people would spend time bathing together, it was considered a very social
    activity. At first they wee separated for men and women but eventually in the
    first century AD they had become mixed.

    Small bathhouses were known as Balneum
    which were often found in peoples houses but could be opened to the public for
    a fee. larger Bath houses like the one found in Vindolanda were called Thermae
    and were open to the public. in 1715 it was found that the Bath house had an
    altar there which would have been used for worship and prayer."'
  funFacts: '1) Some large Bathhouses were built on hot springs so the water would
    be nice and warm!

    2) Bath houses were known for including reading rooms,
    libraries, food and booths that sold perfume!'
