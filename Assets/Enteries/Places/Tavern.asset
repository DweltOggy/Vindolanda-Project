  description: Much like you today Romans enjoyed their leisure time!
  expandedDescription: The Romans loved their leisure activities which they indulged
    in all across their Empire. Everyone has heard of Gladiators, right? This was
    one of their favourite passtimes, they would go to one of their many amphitheatres
    to watch the fighting. The Romans would also engage in more gentle entertainment
    such as board games, card games and dice games. The remains of dice were found
    at Vindolanda, which were thought to have been used to provide entertainment
    for the soldiers as they rested in the barracks.
  funFacts: '1) Some gladitorial fights would even include wild animals such as Lions
    and Bears!

    2) Romans were a fan of sport and athletics such as: Wrestling,
    Boxing, Throwing and Jumping. All sports we still love today!'
