  description: A place where the citizens could come to buy goods.
  expandedDescription: A large party of Roman wealth came from Roman Trade- this
    is how they traded fish, fruit, vegetables, wine, herbs, clothes, materials and
    even horses. Trade was often ran by slaves, they did most of the hard work such
    as transporting a lot of the goods to and from market stalls. They were also
    expected to travel city to city along the long and straight Roman roads. Trade
    was also inter national, many of the Roman goods were traded over seas, all around
    the world.
